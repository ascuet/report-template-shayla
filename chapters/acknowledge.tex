I am overwhelmed to get this opportunity to express my gratitude to those whose constant support and encouragement lead me to the completion of my thesis on human robot interaction.
First and foremost, I feel immense proud to express my heartfelt respect and deepest sense of gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Dr. Mohammed Moshiul Hoque for his scholarly guidance, instruction, constructive criticism, valuable suggestions, supervision, inspiration, untiring assistance in all phases of the research work and in the preparation of the report manuscript. Without his pedagogic supervision, heartfelt help, unfailing attention, and constructive criticism this report would not have seen the light of the day. I am ever grateful to the honorable examination board member for their valuable suggestion, helpful comment, and affectionate feeling.

I am incredibly grateful to all the faculty members
and the staff of department of CSE, CUET for their support. My friends, colleagues and several students  of CUET deserves special thanks for their assistance to make this work possible.
I express my cordial respect and sincere appreciation to my parents for their unforgettable kind co-operation, constructive suggestions, sacrifice, and cordial support in all spheres of the working period.

 Finally, all praises to Allah, the Almighty because it is He, who give me the strength and courage to accomplish the task and achieve the goal.
